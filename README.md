Project Name: Implementation of Red-Black tree and its comparison with AVL tree while reading data from a file

Project descripton: The project is to show the use of Red-Black tree as a more time-efficient tree when it comes to insertion or deletion in a BST as it takes less number of rotations to balance compared to any other self-balancing BST and hence it has a wider application in industry than other self-balancing BSTs, like Linux scheduler, or during frequent data mining etc.

The code was tested on various compilers like Code::Blocks IDE, Dev C++, and Visual Studio and various online compilers. The code is free from errors in those compilers.
